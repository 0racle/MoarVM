# MoarVMMoarVM (short for Metamodel On A Runtime) is a runtime centered on the6model meta-programming world view. Like 6model, it is decidedly builtwith Perl 6 in mind, but since Perl 6 is designed to be twisted into allmanner of shapes then no doubt MoarVM can be put to work in a bunch ofdifferent situations too.## Key PrinciplesMoarVM is interesting (or, depending on your needs, perhaps uninteresting)in a few ways.* MoarVM is gradually typed, rather than having a focus on static or dynamic  typing. In general, it is built to use type information when it has it,  but is comfortable operating in an absence of it too.* MoarVM has a notion of ubiquitous representation polymorphism; storage  strategy is on a separate plane to the nominal type system.  * MoarVM doesn't have any kind of intermediate language or assembly  language; as input, it takes a low level AST, which is packed in a  binary form. Of course, you could develop an IL that translates to  the AST, but the official interface is the AST.
