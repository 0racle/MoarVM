What next?
DONE * Turn qast.t into an actual test harness thingy
DONE * Implement QAST::SVal and QAST::NVal compilation (should be easy)
DONE * Add tests for this
DONE * Get MoarVM op argument type information generated into lib/MAST/Ops.nqp;
DONE   we'll also need whether the operands are read or written
DONE * Get compile_mastop to check argument types (later we'll do coerce stuff)
DONE * Get compile_mastop to handle instructions that return a result
DONE * Write various tests to exercise QAST::VM

Note that the QAST::VM.new(moarop => '...', ...) handling will lie at the
base of compiling many things in QAST::Op.
