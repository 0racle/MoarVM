What next?

look at getting the nqp op to moar op mapping infrastructure
set up (a bit like the stuff in QAST::Operations that maps nqp ops to pirops). Note we don't
need the signature bit, since we have all that information available already. Only thing
we'll need is an optional "what arg to use as the result" for void ops that should evaluate
to one of the args.
For nqp::op that maps naturally to moarops we can just make something that sets up the mapper
For any more complicated cases, it's fine, we just have to do a closure that does the mapping work.
