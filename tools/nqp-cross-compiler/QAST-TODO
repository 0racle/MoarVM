What next?

look at getting the nqp op to moar op mapping infrastructure
set up (a bit like the stuff in QAST::Operations that maps nqp ops to pirops). Note we don't
need the signature bit, since we have all that information available already. Only thing
we'll need is an optional "what arg to use as the result" for void ops that should evaluate
to one of the args.
For nqp::op that maps naturally to moarops we can just make something that sets up the mapper
For any more complicated cases, it's fine, we just have to do a closure that does the mapping work.

work out having more than one QAST::Block
If you implement QAST::BVal (which really boils down to getcode) then you could also
implement QAST::Op.new( :op('call'), ... )
The case where there's no :name(...) so the first child is the thing to invoke.
Note that in MAST, blocks can't contain blocks, so each newly encountered block needs to
add_frame to the MAST compilation unit.
You can probably get immediate blocks to be called automatically.
I guess even declarations of blocks can work too
