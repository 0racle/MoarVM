New in 2014.02

+ Increased precision of num => str coercion
+ Mechanism for per-HLL handling of method resolution errors
+ Gave can the same null-check semantics as findmethod
+ Fixed various "not found" lexical lookup semantics
+ Use a more efficient encoding for integers in the serialization blob
+ Implemented reposession conflict resolution handling for objects
+ Optimized GC worklist processing to avoid unrequired barriers
+ Added a GDB plugin to help analyse VM data structures, heap use, etc.
+ Zeroed memory in a few places, to avoid reading junk and quiet Valgrind
+ Simplified and fixed UTF-16 encoding
+ Implemented unsigned native integer array support
+ Added various missing write barriers on STables
+ Added openpipe functionality, to support qx/qqx in Perl 6
+ Corrected accidental and potentially explosive use of REPR(...) on STables
+ Switched to using flag bits to mark liveness in GC
+ GC forwarder pointer used in nursery now overwrites existing object body,
  saving 4 or 8 bytes on every collectable object
+ Added various GC sanity checking asserts to aid debugging
+ Encapsulated all serialization context accesses
+ Defined NDEBUG in optimized builds
+ P6bigint no longer uses libtommath for integers fitting within 32 bits
+ Optimized serialization of P6bigints fitting within 32 bits
+ Implemented link and symlink
+ Fixed mod_n op's behavior on negatives
+ Implemented floating point fallback case of the pow_I op
+ Fixed srand op to also control rand_I
+ Initialize the random seed at startup
+ Properly clean up active handlers that we unwind over
+ Radix parsing now returns an array of integers, not floating point
+ Huge refactor of I/O, fixing many bugs and leading to cleaner code
+ Proper handling of characters split over byte buffer boundaries in I/O
+ Corrected Latin-1 to be Latin-1, and added Windows-1252 encoding
+ Added a constant cache for boxing integers 0 through 15
+ Properly implemented synchronous client and server TCP socket support
+ Better estimate and perhaps shrink string memory for UTF-8 decode
+ Added probing to Configure to learn how the compiler does 'static inline'
+ Switched many macros over to static inline functions
